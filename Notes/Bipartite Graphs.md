> [!Abstract] Definition
> A [[Graphs|graph]] $G$ is **bipartite** if $nodes(G)$ can be partitioned into sets $X$ and $Y$ in such a way that no two nodes of $X$ are joined and no two nodes of $Y$ are joined.

Here is a **bipartite** **graph**:

$K_{3,3}$ from [[Planar Graphs#^93d837|before]] is also a **bipartite graph**:

>A **graph** is **bipartite** iff it is [[Map Colouring|2-colourable]].

It is not always obvious if a **graph** is **bipartite**.
For example, the cube graph is **2-colourable**, and therefore **bipartite**:
