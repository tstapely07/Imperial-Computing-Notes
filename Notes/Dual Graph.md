> We can turn a **map** into a [[Planar Graphs|planar graph]] by letting the countries be the [[Nodes|nodes]], and joining them if they are neighbours on the map.
> This [[Graphs|graph]] is called the **dual graph**.

Let us note that **dual graphs** of maps are always **simple** and [[Planar Graphs|planar]].
Conversely, any **simple planar graph** is the **dual graph** of some map.
