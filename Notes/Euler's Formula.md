Any [[Planar Graphs|planar graph]], $G$, splits the plane into regions, called **faces**.

Let $G$ have $N$ [[Nodes|nodes]], $A$, [[Arcs|arcs]], and $F$ faces.
**Euler's formula** states that, for a **connected planar graph**:$$F=A-N+2$$

For example, the cube graph has $6$ faces, including the outside:

* We can confirm that $6=12-8+2$
