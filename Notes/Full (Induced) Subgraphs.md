> [!Abstract] Definition
> Any subset $X\subseteq nodes(G)$ **induces** a [[Subgraphs|subgraph]] $G[X]$ of $G$, where $G[X]$ has nodes $X$, and $G[X]$ contains all [[Arcs|arcs]] of $G$ which join [[Nodes|nodes]] in $X$. 
> $G'$ is a **full** (or **induced**) subgraph of $G$ if $G'=G[X]$ for some $X\subseteq nodes(G)$.
