> [!Abstract] Definition
> In an **adjacency matrix**, each $i,j$ entry represents how many [[Arcs|arcs]] connect $i$ to $j$.

For an **undirected** [[Graphs|graph]], the **matrix** will be **symmetric**.
Note that if we order the nodes differently, the matrix gets rearranged.
The diagonal entries count the number of **loops**. 
* As per our definition of [[Degrees|degrees]], a single loop is counted **twice**.
The sum of a **column** or **row** represents that [[Nodes|node's]] [[Degrees|degree]].

Here's an **example**:
