**Parameterised data types** are **[[Types, Values, and Functions|types]]** that take **one or more** **other types** as **arguments**.

They include:
* [[Maybe]] - `data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a`.
* [[Either]] - `data Either a b = Left a | Right b`.
* [[Trees]] - trees can have various shapes.
* [[Lists]] - `data [a] = [] | a : [a]`
